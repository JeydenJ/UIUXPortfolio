Project Details
CirQus Fridge Monitoring
This project focuses on developing a web application for monitoring fridge temperature, primarily targeting technology advisors responsible for managing fridge systems. As a UI/UX designer, I played a key role in shaping the visual identity and interaction design of the application.

FlashcardGO
FlashcardGO is an app designed to help university students study while commuting on trains. Our solution combines the train system with flashcards in a symbiotic relationship to benefit users who like to study during transit.
